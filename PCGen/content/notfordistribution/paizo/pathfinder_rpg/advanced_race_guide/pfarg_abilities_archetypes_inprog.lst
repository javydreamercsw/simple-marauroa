Class Skills	KEY:Class Skills ~ Ancient Lorekeeper	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:An ancient lorekeeper adds Knowledge (arcane) and Knowledge (local) to her list of class skills. Whenever she makes a Knowledge check of any kind about a question regarding elves (creatures of the elf subtype), the ancient lorekeeper adds half her class level on her check. This replaces the bonus skills the ancient lorekeeper gains from her mystery.
Elven Arcana	KEY:Elven Arcana ~ Ancient Lorekeeper	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 2nd level, an ancient lorekeeper's mastery of elven legends and philosophy has allowed her to master one spell used by elven wizards. She selects one spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list that is at least one level lower than the highest-level oracle spell she can cast. The ancient lorekeeper gains this as a bonus spell known. The spell is treated as one level higher than its true level for all purposes. The ancient lorekeeper may choose an additional spell at 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 18th levels. This ability replaces the bonus spells she would normally gain at these levels from her chosen mystery.

Many elven magi do not consider themselves masters of a blend of martial and magical talents, but rather a sub-category of wizards who study the effect of physical movement and techniques upon spellcasting ability. They believe their ability to cast spells while fighting is an outgrowth of the concept of the "spell dance," which itself is just another kind of wizardry. A spell dancer has the following class features.

Spell Dance				KEY:Spell Dance ~ Spell Dancer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a spell dancer gains the ability to expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to gain a +10 enhancement bonus to his movement rate and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity provoked by moving through threatened spaces for 1 minute. For every four levels beyond 1st, the spell dancer gains another +10 enhancement bonus to movement and +2 to AC against attacks of opportunity provoked from movement. At 5th level, once per spell dance as a swift action, the spell dancer may use one of the following on himself as a swift action: blur, fly, or haste. These abilities last for 1 round. At 9th level, the spell dancer may instead take a swift action to use dimension door as a spell-like ability once during a spelldance. At 13th level, the spell dancer may instead choose to take a swift action to gain freedom of movement for 1d4 rounds. This ability replaces the magus's ability to expend points from his arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon he is holding magic bonuses for 1 minute.
Arcane Movement			KEY:Arcane Movement ~ Spell Dancer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 5th level, whenever a spell dancer casts a magus spell, he gains a competence bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, and Stealth checks equal to the spell's level until the beginning of his next turn. This ability replaces the bonus feat a magus receives at 5th level.
Dance of Avoidance		KEY:Dance of Avoidance ~ Spell Dancer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 7th level, while wearing light armor or no armor, a spell dancer gains a +2 insight bonus to Armor Class. This ability replaces the medium armor class feature.

These spells become so well understood by the spellbinder that he can prepare them in spell slots that already have other spells prepared in them.

Spell Bond		KEY:Spell Bond ~ Spellbinder	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a spellbinder selects any one spell that he knows as a bonded spell. As a full-round action, the spellbinder may replace a spell of the same or higher level as his bonded spell with his bonded spell. For example, a spellbinder who selects magic missile as his bonded spell could spend a full-round action to exchange any 1st-level or higher spell that he has prepared with magic missile. At 3rd level, and every two levels thereafter, a spellbinder may select another spell he knows and add it to his list of bonded spells, to a maximum of nine bonded spells at 17th level. Upon reaching 4th level, and every two levels thereafter, a spellbinder can choose to select a new spell as a bonded spell in place of one with which he is already bonded. In effect, the spellbinder loses the bond with the old spell (though it is still one of his spells known) in exchange for forging a spell bond with a new spell. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A spellbinder may swap only one spell bond at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell bond at the same time that he gains two new spells known for the level. This ability replaces arcane bond.

	DESC:Elves live far longer than other common races, and a single elf may see whole empires rise and fall. Given the impermanence of the cultures around them, it's small wonder that some elves turn to the timeless growth of nature for solace, finding allies among the great trees themselves, and even leading the forest's plants into combat. A treesinger has the following class features.

Plant Bond		KEY:Plant Bond ~ Treesinger		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 1st level, a treesinger forms a mystic bond with plant life. This bond can take one of two forms. The first grants the treesinger one of the following domains: Plant (Core Rulebook); Growth (Advanced Player's Guide); Jungle, Swamp (Ultimate Magic). When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the treesinger's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A treesinger who selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot, and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously. The second option is to form a close bond with a plant companion. A treesinger may begin play with any of the plants listed in Plant Companions (see page 26). This plant is a loyal companion that accompanies the treesinger on her adventures. Except for the companion being a creature of the plant type, drawn from the list of plant companions, this ability otherwise works like the standard druid's animal companion ability. Plant bond replaces the druid's nature bond ability.
Green Empathy	KEY:Green Empathy ~ Treesinger	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 1st level, a treesinger can improve the attitude of a plant creature. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The treesinger rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical wild plant creature has a starting attitude of indifferent. To use green empathy, the treesinger and the plant creature must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing a plant creature in this way takes 1 minute but, as with inf luencing people, it might take more or less time. A treesinger can also use this ability to inf luence an animal, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check. This ability replaces the wild empathy class feature.
Wild Shape		KEY:Wild Shape ~ Treesinger		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 4th level, a treesinger gains the ability to wild shape. This ability functions at her actual druid level. A treesinger cannot use wild shape to adopt an animal or elemental form. Instead, when she gains this ability at 4th level, she can assume the form of a Small or Medium plant. This functions as plant shape I, except the treesinger does not yet gain access to the constrict or poison abilities of the plant form assumed. At 8th level, the treesinger's wild shape gains the full range of abilities available from plant shape I. At 10th level, a treesinger can assume the form of a Large or Tiny plant. Her wild shape ability now functions like plant shape II. At 12th level, a treesinger can assume the form of a Huge plant. Her wild shape ability now functions like plant shape III. This ability replaces, and otherwise functions like, the normal druid wild shape ability.

#Plant Companions
#Each plant companion has different starting sizes, speed, attacks, ability scores, and special qualities. All plant attacks are made using the creature's full base attack bonus unless otherwise noted. Plant attacks add the plant's Strength modifier on the damage roll, unless it has only one attack, in which case it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier. Some plant companions have special abilities, such as scent. Plant companions cannot gain armor or weapon proficiency feats, even as they advance in hit dice, and cannot use manufactured weapons at all unless their description says otherwise. As you gain levels, your plant companion grows in power as well. It gains the same bonuses that are gained by animal companions, noted on Table 3-8: Animal Companion Base Statistics on page 52 of the Core Rulebook. Each plant companion gains an additional bonus, usually at 4th or 7th level, as listed with each plant choice. Instead of taking the listed benefit at 4th level, you can instead choose to increase the companion's Strength and Constitution by 2.

Prankster	KEY:Bard Archetype ~ Prankster	CATEGORY:Archetype	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:Archetype.BardArchetype		PRECLASS:1,Bard=1	PRERACE:1,Elf%	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,Bard Archetype ~ Prankster],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]	DESC:The prankster sees humor as the highest form or art, and pranks as the highest form of humor. In addition to setting friends up for light-hearted pranks, the prankster can use his quick wit and cruel sense of humor to enrage foes before incapacitating them with a clever turn of phrase.

#This ability replaces fascinate.

#This ability replaces lore master.

Bardic Performance	KEY:Bardic Performance ~ Prankster	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A prankster's bardic performance functions like a bard's, but some of its performances are exchanged for those listed below.
Mock				KEY:Mock ~ Prankster	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, the prankster can use his performance to cause one or more creatures to become furious with him. Each creature to be mocked must be within 90 feet, able to see, hear, and understand the prankster, and capable of paying attention to him. The prankster must also be able to see the creatures affected. For every three levels the prankster has attained beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with this ability. Each creature within range receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the prankster's level + the prankster's Charisma modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the prankster cannot successfully mock that creature for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature is angered by the performance and seeks to harm the prankster. While the prankster maintains the mocking, the target takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and skill checks until it has successfully attacked the prankster with a melee or ranged attack, or has harmed the creature with a spell that deals damage. Mock is an enchantment (compulsion) mind-affecting ability. Mock relies on audible and visual components in order to function. This ability replaces fascinate.
Punchline			KEY:Punchline ~ Prankster	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:At 6th level, the prankster can use his performance to tell a punchline to amuse a creature he has already mocked (see above), goading it into hideous laughter (as the spell). Using this ability does not disrupt the mock effect, but it does require a standard action to activate (in addition to the free action to continue the mock effect). A prankster can use this ability more than once against an individual creature during an individual performance. Telling a punchline does not count against a prankster's daily use of bardic performance. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Charisma modif ier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature. Punchline is an enchantment (compulsion), mind affecting, language dependent ability and relies on audible components. This ability replaces the suggestion ability.
Mass Punchline		KEY:Mass Punchline ~ Prankster	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:This ability functions just like punchline, but allows a prankster of 18th level or higher to use hideous laughter simultaneously against any number of creatures that he has mocked. This ability replaces the mass suggestion ability.
Swap				KEY:Swap ~ Prankster	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A prankster can steal an object from a creature and replace it with another object of the same size or smaller that the prankster has in his hand. This functions as the steal combat maneuver (Advanced Player's Guide 322), but the prankster does not provoke an attack of opportunity, and may use his Sleight of Hand check in place of his combat maneuver check. If the prankster's check exceeds the target's CMD by 10 or more, the target is unaware the swap has been made until it tries to use the swapped object or the end of its next turn (whichever happens first). This ability replaces lore master.

A saboteur has focused his alchemical research toward new ways to conceal his presence, sow confusion, and blow up large structures.

Class Skills			KEY:Class Skills ~ Saboteur	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A saboteur adds Knowledge (engineering) to his list of class skills and removes Knowledge (nature) from his list of class skills.
Chameleon Mutagen			KEY:Chameleon Mutagen ~ Saboteur	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a saboteur discovers how to create a special elixir that he can imbibe in order to heighten his ability to move undetected and his mobility at the cost of his physical might. When consumed, the elixir causes the saboteur's skin to change color to match the background and causes his hands and feet to secrete a sticky residue. This grants him a circumstance bonus on Stealth checks equal to half his alchemist level (minimum +1), as well as granting him a climb speed equal to half his base speed, for 10 minutes per saboteur level. In addition, while the chameleon extract is in effect, the saboteur takes a -2 penalty to his Strength. This ability replaces mutagen. A saboteur who drinks an alchemist's mutagen is treated as a non-alchemist. All limitations to mutagens apply to chameleon mutagen as if it were the same ability. The infuse mutagen discovery and persistent mutagen class ability apply to the chameleon mutagen.

Bore Bomb*				KEY:Discovery ~ Bore Bomb ~ Saboteur			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	TYPE:AlchemistDiscovery.SpecialQuality	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Saboteur Discoveries ~ Saboteur	DESC:When the saboteur creates a bomb, he may choose to make it a bore bomb. If a bore bomb strikes a wall, gate, siege engine, or similar large, solid, inanimate structure, it ignores half the target's hardness and deals 1 point of damage per saboteur level. If a bore bomb reduces an inanimate target to half its hit points or fewer, it blows a hole 5 feet wide and 5 feet deep in the target.
Complex Bomb			KEY:Discovery ~ Complex Bomb ~ Saboteur			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	TYPE:AlchemistDiscovery.SpecialQuality	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Saboteur Discoveries ~ Saboteur	DESC:When the saboteur creates a bomb, he can choose to have it modif ied by two different discoveries that modify a bomb's damage (those discoveries marked with an asterisk). Each discovery modif ies half the bomb's damage dice, rounding down. For example, a concussive/frost bomb from a 9th-level saboteur deals 2d4 points of sonic damage + 2d6 points of frost damage. Creating a complex bomb counts as 2 daily uses of the bomb ability.

	DESC:While all witches commune with the unknown, the blend of human ingenuity and adept learning mixed with elven blood gives some half-elves a unique conduit to channel the powers of the arcane. Bonded witches forsake familiars as vessels of power in favor of a specific object that grants them powers above and beyond those of their patron alone, as they tap into the powerful magic of the item itself. A bonded witch has the following class features.

# COMMENT: Need to implement
# COMMENT: I've broken it down to Items, but we need to make this a choice and grant properly
Bonded Item	KEY:Bonded Item ~ Bonded Witch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.43	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:At 1st level, a bonded witch gains a bonded item instead of a familiar. This bonded item is similar to a wizard's arcane bond bonded item (Core Rulebook 78), and follows all the rules of such an item with the following exceptions. A bonded witch's bonded item serves as a vessel for her spells and a conduit for communication with her patron. A bonded witch must commune with her bonded item each day to prepare her spells. The bonded item stores all of the spells that the bonded witch knows, and the bonded witch cannot prepare spells that are not stored within it. A bonded witch starts with the same number of spells and gains new spells the same way as a witch, and can even add spells by learning them from scrolls in the same way (Advanced Player's Guide 68), but a bonded witch cannot learn spells from another bonded item. Since a bonded witch does not have a spellbook, starting at 2nd level, a bonded witch's bonded item can be used once per day to cast a spell dependent on the type of bonded object chosen by the bonded witch. The spell is treated like any other spell cast by the bonded witch, including its casting time, duration, and other effects dependent of the bonded witch's level. This spell cannot be further modified by metamagic feats or any other ability. As the bonded witch gains levels, the bonded item gains new spells that the bonded witch can cast in this way. She can cast any one of these spells once per day using her bonded object, but gains greater f lexibility in what spells she can cast, and gains more powerful spells as she gains new levels. The bonded item spells associated with each item type are as follows.

In addition, the alchemist gains fast healing 1 as long as he is in an area of bright light (such as sunlight or inside the area of a daylight spell). This otherwise works like the standard mutagen class feature and replaces that ability. A bramble brewer who selects the greater mutagen discovery can create a dendrite mutagen that still grants a +4 natural armor bonus, and also grants a +4 alchemical bonus to one physical ability score and a +2 bonus to a second physical ability score. The bramble brewer takes a -2 penalty to both associated mental ability scores as long as the mutagen persists, but his fast healing increases to 3 as long as he is in an area of bright light. This otherwise works like the greater mutagen discovery and replaces that ability. A bramble brewer who selects the grand mutagen discovery can brew a dendrite mutagen that now grants a +6 natural armor bonus, a +6 alchemical bonus to one physical ability score, a +4 alchemical bonus to a second physical ability score, and a +2 alchemical bonus to a third physical ability score. The bramble brewer takes a -2 penalty to his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores as long as the mutagen persists. The bramble brewer's fast healing increases to 5 as long as he is within an area of bright light. This otherwise works like the grand mutagen discovery and replaces that ability.

The bramble brewer's gains fast healing 10, but instead of only gaining fast healing in bright light, this fast healing persists in areas of bright or normal light. A bramble brewer must possess the grand mutagen discovery before selecting this discovery.

Such attacks can make foes fumble or cause them to become entangled within areas of the wild shadow's favored terrain. As a standard action, the wild shadow denotes one target within line of sight and within one of his favored terrains as his harried prey. Once the foe is so designated, every time the wild shadow hits this harried prey with a melee or ranged weapon attack (either manufactured or natural), that creature is entangled for 1 round. A wild shadow can have no more than one harried prey at a time and that creature must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, be he cannot select a new harried prey for 24 hours. If the wild shadow sees proof that his harried prey is dead, he can select a new harried prey after waiting 1 hour. This ability replaces the quarry class feature.

Blood Feast		KEY:Blood Feast ~ Blood God Disciple	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.53	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a blood god disciple can feed a recently fallen foe to his eidolon, allowing the outsider to channel some of its power into the summoner. The eidolon must spend a standard action to eat some of the opponent, which must be a living, corporeal creature killed or knocked unconscious by the eidolon or summoner in the past minute. This eating deals damage to the target as if the eidolon had attacked it with one natural attack (typically a bite). The fallen creature must have at least half as many Hit Dice as the summoner. Once the feeding is complete, the summoner may manifest one 1-point evolution. This lasts for 1 minute. The evolution's effects use the summoner's Hit Dice and ability scores rather than the eidolon's. The blood god disciple can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. He may only apply one use of this ability at a time (using it a second time replaces any evolution manifested with this ability), and can only manifest evolutions his eidolon has. At 5th level, when the blood god disciple uses blood feast, he may manifest one 2-point evolution instead of a 1-point evolution. At 9th level, he may manifest up to two evolutions worth a total of 3 evolution points or fewer. At 13th level, he may manifest up to two evolutions worth a total of 4 evolution points or fewer. At 17th level, he may manifest up to three evolutions worth a total of 5 evolution points or fewer. This ability replaces the summon monster I, III, V, VII, and IX spell-like abilities.
Bloody Gift		KEY:Bloody Gift ~ Blood God Disciple	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 3rd level, when a blood god disciple uses blood feast to manifest an evolution, he may touch one ally and grant it that evolution as well. Each affected ally counts as one use per day of the blood feast ability. At 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th level, the blood god disciple can affect an additional creature with this ability (each one counting as a use per day of blood feast). If the blood god disciple can manifest multiple evolutions per use of blood feast, his selected allies manifest these multiple evolutions as well. This ability replaces the summon monster II spell-like ability.
Avatar Gambit	KEY:Avatar Gambit ~ Blood God Disciple	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 7th level, when a blood god disciple dismisses his eidolon, he rages like a barbarian for a number of rounds equal to half his summoner level (he may end this rage early just like a barbarian, but if he does so, any remaining rounds of rage from this ability are lost). This replaces the summon monster IV spell-like ability.
Rage Power		KEY:Rage Power ~ Blood God Disciple		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 11th level and 15th level, a blood god disciple selects a barbarian rage power, which he may use when raging (whether from the avatar gambit ability or actual barbarian rage).

This ability works identically to the ranger ability of the same name. At 8th, 14th, and 20th level, the hateful rager selects another favored enemy and increases her bonus against one favored enemy type, as described in the ranger class. While raging, the hateful rager makes every effort to fight a favored enemy rather than other opponents. If aware of the presence of a favored enemy, the hateful rager must make a DC 20 Will save each round to attack another creature; failure means the barbarian must attack the favored enemy or move closer to that enemy. She may freely attack creatures preventing her from reaching that favored enemy (regardless of whether they are actively trying to prevent her attacks or merely in the way). She can avoid harmful obstacles normally in her attempts to reach the target and is not forced to take the shortest route. This ability replaces the barbarian's rage power gained at 2nd level. At 8th, 14th, and 20th levels, in place of a rage power she gains another favored enemy and increases her bonus against one favored enemy type.

Her caster level for this ability is equal to her paladin level. Rather than assigning a mission or task, the redeemer gives the creature a simple set of prohibitions to protect others. Example geas include "Leave this city and do not return" or "Do not attack caravans." The prohibition must be against an area no larger than 300 square miles or one specific group of people (such as a tribe or citizens of a particular city). This ability lasts 1 month per paladin level. This replaces aura of resolve.

Quicker than the Eye	KEY:Quicker than the Eye ~ Filcher	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 2nd level, a filcher develops an amazingly swift and delicate touch. When she uses Sleight of Hand, creatures take a penalty on their Perception checks to notice the attempt equal to half the filcher's class level. The filcher also subtracts her class level from the normal -20 penalty when attempting to make a Sleight of Hand check as a move action instead of as a standard action. Lastly, the filcher can withdraw an object hidden on her person, including a weapon, as a move action instead of the usual standard action. This ability replaces evasion.
Rummage			KEY:Rummage ~ Filcher			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 3rd level, a filcher learns how to assess the value of items at the quickest glance. She can even make startlingly accurate guesses about particular items merely by observing the bulges they make in pouches, backpacks, or similar containers. She gains a +1 bonus on Appraise checks and an additional +1 bonus every three levels thereafter. As a swift action, a filcher can make an Appraise check in order to determine the relative value of each object carried by her target (DC = 10 + 1 for every object the filcher is trying to ascertain the relative value of ). Though she never learns the actual prices of items when using rummage, she does gain enough information to list these items in order, from the most valuable to the least valuable. She can, by taking a -20 penalty on the check, add to this assessment any items carried by her target that she cannot see. This ability replaces trap sense +1, +2, +3, +4, +5, and +6.
Filch				KEY:Filch ~ Filcher			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 4th level, a filcher learns how pluck items off her opponents even in combat. She gains Improved Steal (Advanced Player's Guide 163) as a bonus feat and can use her Sleight of Hand bonus instead of her CMB when performing a steal combat maneuver (Advanced Player's Guide 322). If the filcher gains bonuses on combat maneuver checks from any feats, spells, magic items, or similar effects, they are added to the Sleight of Hand bonus when using the steal maneuver. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.
Superior Filching		KEY:Superior Filching ~ Filcher	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 8th level, a filcher becomes a master at separating owners from their property.

Furthermore, the summon monster lists are modified in the following ways (these changes also apply to using a higher-level summon spell to summon multiple creatures from a lower-level list). Summon Monster I: No changes. Summon Monster II: A shadow caller cannot summon Small elementals or lemures, but instead can summon zoogs (Bestiary 3 288). Summon Monster III: A shadow caller cannot summon dretches or lantern archons, but can summon augur kytons (Bestiary 3 171). Summon Monster IV: A shadow caller cannot summon Medium elementals, hell hounds, hound archons, or mephits, but can summon allips (Bestiary 3 12), gloomwings (Bestiary 2 133), and shadows (Bestiary 245). Summon Monster V: A shadow caller cannot summon babau, bearded devils, bralani azatas, Large elementals, salamanders, or xills, but can summon shadow mastiffs (Bestiary 3 241) and shae (Bestiary 3 242). Summon Monster VI: A shadow caller cannot summon Huge elementals, erinyes, lillend azatas, or succubi, but can summon cloakers (Bestiary 47). Summon Monster VII: A shadow caller cannot summon bebiliths, bone devils, greater elementals, or vrocks, but can summon greater shadows (Bestiary 245). Summon Monster VIII: A shadow caller can only summon derghodaemons (Bestiary 3 66) and young umbral dragons (Bestiary 2 102). Summon Monster IX: A shadow caller can only summon interlocutor kytons (Bestiary 3 174) and nightwings (Bestiary 3 203). This ability otherwise functions as and replaces the summoner's normal summon monster spell-like abilities.

Shadow Eidolon 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A shadow caller's eidolon is at once a thing of shadow called from the deep of the Shadow Plane and his own shadow; the two are inseparable. When his eidolon manifests, his shadow lengthens and finally detaches from him as a creature unto itself. For as long as the shadow caller's eidolon is manifested, he and the eidolon do not have distinct shadows, regardless of the presence or absence of light. This lack of a shadow replaces the magical symbol that identifies the summoner and his eidolon. This ability alters the summoner's eidolon ability.

Feral Gnasher (Barbarian)		KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]
Feral gnashers grow up in the wild, either raised by animals or scraping by on their own, and soon learn to fend for themselves. These barbarians often utilize pieced-together armor and fight with their sharp teeth and whatever improvised weapons are within reach. A feral gnasher has the following class features.
Weapon and Armor Proficiency 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A feral gnasher loses all martial weapon proficiencies except for greatclub and loses proficiency with medium armor.
Savage Bite (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, a feral gnasher gains a savage bite attack. This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d4 points of damage. If the goblin already has the hard head, big teeth racial trait, the damage increases to 1d6. At 10th level, the damage from a feral gnasher's bite increases to 1d6 (or 1d8 if the goblin has the hard head, big teeth racial trait) and deals ?3 damage on a critical hit. This ability replaces fast movement.
Impromptu Armament (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 2nd level, a feral gnasher gains Throw Anything as a bonus feat and can pick up an unattended object that can be wielded in one hand as a free action. Additionally, the feral gnasher can take Catch Off-Guard in place of a rage power. This replaces the rage power gained at second level.
Lockjaw (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 3rd level, a feral gnasher gains the grab ability with her bite attack. A feral gnasher can use this ability on a creature up to one size category larger than she is. This replaces trap sense +1.
Improvised Weapon Mastery (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 5th level, a feral gnasher gains Improvised Weapon Mastery as a bonus feat. This replaces improved uncanny dodge.
Improved Lockjaw (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 6th level, as long as a feral gnasher is controlling the grapple with her lockjaw attack, she does not gain the grappled condition, but is unable to move or use her mouth for anything other than grappling. This ability replaces trap sense +2.
Greater Lockjaw (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 9th level and again at 15th level, the size of a creature a feral gnasher is able to use her lockjaw's grab ability on increases by one size increment. This ability replaces trap sense +3 and trap sense +5.
Wicked Improvisation (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 12th level, a feral gnasher becomes more capable with improvised weapons and natural attacks. The feral gnasher gains a +1 competence bonus on damage rolls when using natural attacks or improvised weapons while raging. At 14th level and every two levels thereafter, the damage bonus increases by +1. This increase is not precision damage and is thus multiplied on a critical hit. This ability replaces trap sense +4.

Fire bombers are exceptionally good at using bombs to burn creatures and blow things up, but are not quite as good at creating other types of bombs or extracts. A fire bomber has the following class features.
Weapon and Armor Proficiency 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A fire bomber treats torches as a simple weapon.
Fire Bombardier (Su or Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, when a fire bomber throws a bomb that deals fire damage, all creatures in the splash radius take an additional point of damage per die of fire damage dealt. Fire bombers only add their Intelligence bonus to damage from bombs or alchemical substances that deal fire damage. This otherwise works like the alchemist's bomb and throw anything abilities. This ability alters bomb and throw anything.
Bonus Feats 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A fire bomber can select the Burn! Burn! Burn!, Fire Tamer, or Flame Heart feat in place of a discovery.
Fiery Cocktail (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 4th level, whenever a fire bomber uses a discovery that deals damage other than fire damage, he can split the damage dice evenly between the bomb's primary damage type and 1d6 points of fire damage; when there is an odd number of damage dice, the odd die of damage comes from the primary damage type. For example, an 8th-level fire bomber could throw a concussive bomb that deals 2d6 points of fire damage and 3d4 points of sonic damage. Additional effects from the bomb still apply, but the save DC for admixture bombs is reduced by 2. This replaces the alchemist's 4th-level discovery.
Fire Body (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 8th level, a fire bomber adds elemental body I to his extract list as a 3rd-level extract. Elemental body extracts prepared using fire body are limited to fire elementals only. This ability replaces poison resistance +6.
Improved Fire Body (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 10th level, fire bombers add elemental body II to their spell list as a 4th-level extract. Elemental body extracts prepared using improved fire body are limited to fire elementals only. This ability replaces poison immunity.
Greater Fire Body (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 14th level, fire bombers add elemental body IV to their spell list as a 5th-level extract. Elemental body extracts prepared using greater fire body are limited to fire elementals only. This ability replaces persistent mutagen.
Discoveries 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:The following discoveries complement the fire bomber archetype: fire brand, rocket bomb (see sidebar); explosive bombs, fast bombs, inferno bomb, precise bombs (Advanced Player's Guide); breath weapon bomb, explosive missile, immolation bomb (Ultimate Combat); bottled ooze, confusion bomb, strafe bomb (Ultimate Magic).

Fell Rider (Cavalier)		KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]
The fell rider rides a bestial steed, a mount mastered by him alone. He tramples his enemies down, leaving twisted bodies in his wake, and fear rides with him.
Brute Steed (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A fell rider's mount is unusually large and fierce. It gains a +2 bonus to Strength, but takes a -2 penalty to Dexterity. This otherwise works like the cavalier's mount ability and alters that ability.
Rampage (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 3rd level, a fell rider gains Trample as a bonus feat. The fell rider receives a +2 bonus on overrun attempts made while mounted. In addition, his mount gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls when making hoof attacks or using the trample monster ability, even when not overrunning. This ability replaces cavalier's charge.
Dread Rider (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 4th level, a fell rider gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his level on Intimidate checks made while mounted. Once per round as a free action, he can make an Intimidate check to demoralize a foe he has trampled or charged while mounted. This ability replaces expert trainer.
Fell Presence (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 5th level, a fell rider inspires dread while mounted. As long as the fell rider is mounted, all enemies within 60 feet receive a -2 penalty on savings throws against fear. At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter, this penalty increases by -1. This ability replaces banner.
Deadly Rampage (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 11th level, a mounted fell rider no longer provokes attacks of opportunity when he attempts to overrun a creature. He can make a single melee attack against the creature as a free action if the overrun attempt succeeds. This ability replaces mighty charge.
Terror (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 14th level, a fell rider can rear up his mount as a standard action, spreading terror among his enemies. Enemies within 60 feet who can see the fell rider must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the fell rider's level + the fell rider's Charisma modifier) or be shaken for 1 round per level the fell rider possesses. Creatures with half or fewer Hit Dice than the fell rider become frightened instead. An opponent that succeeds at the saving throw is immune to that fell rider's terror ability for 24 hours. This ability is a mind-affecting fear effect, and replaces greater banner.
Unstoppable Rampage (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 20th level, a mounted fell rider can overrun up to four creatures as part of a single overrun combat maneuver. Each attempt made against a creature after the first receives a cumulative -5 penalty (for example, the fourth overrun attempt would be at a -15 penalty). If any overrun attempt fails, the fell rider cannot make further overrun attempts that round. Attacks made by the fell rider or his mount as part of the overrun, such as those provided by the Trample feat or the deadly rampage ability, receive a +4 bonus to hit, and any critical threats from these attacks automatically confirm. This ability replaces supreme charge.

Ironskin Monk (Monk)		KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]
Through discipline and training, an ironskin monk hardens his body to withstand punishing blows. Though slow on his feet, his calloused hands and feet can shatter stone and stagger foes.
Iron Skin (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, an ironskin monk gains a +1 bonus to his natural armor. This bonus stacks with any existing natural armor the ironskin monk already has. At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +1. This ability replaces the monk's AC bonus ability and the ability to add his Wisdom bonus to his AC.
Bonus Feat 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, an ironskin monk adds Power Attack to his list of bonus feats. At 6th level, he adds Improved Sunder to the list. At 10th level, he adds Greater Sunder to the list. These bonus feat choices replace Dodge, Mobility, and Spring Attack on his bonus feat list.
Resilience (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 2nd level, an ironskin monk can shake off the physical effects of certain attacks. If he makes a Fortitude saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, he instead avoids the effect entirely. This ability can be used only if the monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefits of resilience. This ability replaces evasion.

#123
Ki Pool (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 4th level, an ironskin monk can spend 1 point from his ki pool to gain a damage bonus equal to 1/2 his level against objects and constructs for 1 round. This replaces the ability to increase speed with ki.
Staggering Blow (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 5th level, an ironskin monk attacking with an unarmed strike can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a free action after a successful critical hit to stagger the creature struck for 1 round (Fort DC 10 + 1/2 the ironskin monk's level + the ironskin monk's Wisdom modifier negates). This ability replaces high jump.
Tough as Nails (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 6th level, an ironskin monk gains DR 1/-. Subtract 1 point from the damage the ironskin monk takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. This damage reduction increases by 1 point at 9th level and every 3 levels thereafter. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0. This ability replaces fast movement and slow fall.
Evasion (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 9th level, an ironskin monk gains evasion. This ability replaces improved evasion.
Surefooted (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 17th level, an ironskin monk's speed is not reduced by difficult terrain. This ability replaces tongue of the sun and moon.
Unbreakable (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 20th level, an ironskin monk sets aside many of the frailties of mortal f lesh. He becomes immune to death effects and stunning. He is not subject to ability damage or ability drain, and has a 75% chance of ignoring the extra damage dealt by critical hits and sneak attacks. This ability replaces perfect self.

Immolator (Inquisitor)		KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]
The immolator puts her pyromaniacal urges to work in the service of a deity. She brings burning retribution down upon the enemies of her faith, consigning their souls to the sacrificial f lames. An immolator has the following class features.
Servant of the Flame 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:An immolator must worship a deity whose portfolio includes the Fire domain. An immolator who selects the Fire domain (or one of its associated subdomains, if available) uses her domain powers at +1 caster level (this stacks with the ifrit's fire affinity racial trait).
Judgment (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:An immolator gains the following judgment instead of the smiting judgment.
Immolation 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:The immolator channels purifying f lame to consume her enemies. When dealing fire damage to an opponent, she treats the target's fire resistance as 5 lower than normal (minimum 0). At 6th level, she treats the target's resistance as 10 lower than normal, 15 lower than normal at 11th level, and 20 lower than normal at 16th level.
Burnt Offering (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 5th level, as a swift action, an immolator can imbue one of her weapons with the f laming weapon special ability. Any creature slain by this weapon burns with magical f lame; its body turns to ash, though its equipment is not harmed. This special ability only functions while the immolator wields the weapon. This ability lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to the immolator's level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. At 12th level, this ability gives the immolator's weapon the f laming burst weapon special ability. This ability replaces bane and greater bane.
Judgment by Fire (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 20th level, an immolator can call fiery judgment down upon a foe during combat. Whenever an immolator uses her judgment ability, she can invoke a judgment by fire on a foe as a swift action. Once declared, the immolator can make a single melee (or ranged attack, if the foe is within 30 feet) against the target. If the attack hits, the attack deals fire damage instead of weapon damage, and the target must make a successful Fortitude save or die (creatures immune to fire do not have to save). The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the immolator's level + the immolator's Wisdom modifier. Regardless of whether the save is successful, the target creature is immune to the immolator's judgment by fire ability for 24 hours. Creatures killed in this manner explode in a burst of fire, dealing 10d6 points of fire damage to every creature within 5 feet (Ref lex save for half damage, DC 10 + 1/2 the immolator's level + the immolator's Wisdom modifier). Once this ability has been used, it cannot be used again for 1d4 rounds. This ability modifies and functions as true judgment.

Wishcrafter (Sorcerer)		KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]
Wishcrafters are born with a talent for manipulating reality inherited from their efreeti ancestors. However, like the genies they are descended from, wishcrafters can only draw upon this power to fulfill the desires of others. A wishcrafter has the following class features.
Wishbound Arcana (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, the wishcrafter can use the wishes of non-genie creatures other than herself in place of the normal verbal components of her spells. A creature can make a wish as a free action at any time, even during the wishcrafter's turn. The wishcrafter must be able to hear and understand a wish in order to use it as a spell component. A spell that doesn't normally have a verbal component gains one when cast using this ability. A wish doesn't need to mention the name of a specific spell, but must describe an outcome that can be accomplished by casting a spell the wishcrafter knows (for example, wishing to be bigger could supply the verbal component for enlarge person). A wishcrafter gains a +1 bonus to her caster level when using a creature's wish as a verbal component in this manner, but cannot include herself as a target of such spells. She can be affected by such a spell if it affects an area rather than a target or targets. A wishcrafter is under no compulsion to grant a creature's wish. Once the wishcrafter grants a creature's wish using this ability, she cannot use this ability to grant that creature any further wishes for 24 hours. This ability replaces bloodline arcana.
Expanded Wishcraft 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the wishcrafter grows more adept at altering reality to fit the whims of others. She may add an additional spell selected from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to her list of spells known. This spell must be one level lower than the highest-level spell she can cast. A wishcrafter can only use these spells in conjunction with her wishbound arcana ability. For example, if she used this ability to learn cat's grace, she can only cast it when another creature wishes for it, and can't cast it on herself because it is a targeted spell. She cannot use these spells to craft or recharge magic items. These bonus spells replace the bloodline spells gained by the sorcerer's bloodline.
Heart's Desire (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 7th level, as a swift action, a wishcrafter can force a single creature within 30 feet to confess its deepest desire. The target receives a Will save to negate this effect (DC 10 + 1/2 the wishcrafter's level + the wishcrafter's Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the creature must immediately wish aloud in a clear voice for something it truly desires, allowing the wishcrafter to activate her wishbound arcana ability if she knows a spell that can fulfill that wish. This is a mind-affecting effect. Regardless of whether the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of the same wishcrafter's heart's desire ability again for 24 hours. The wishcrafter can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma bonus. This ability replaces the bloodline bonus feat gained at 7th level.

#125

Twisted Wish (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 13th level, a wishcrafter becomes adept at corrupting wishes to negatively affect the creature that wished them. When a wishcrafter affects a creature with a spell using its wish as a spell component, she may twist the wish, applying a -4 penalty to the creature's saving throws against the spell. The effects of wishes twisted this way are difficult to remove; the DC of caster level checks to dispel them increases by 5. This ability replaces the bloodline bonus feat gained at 13th level.
Perfect Wishcraft (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 19th level, the wishcrafter perfects her ability to manipulate reality. Once per day, she may cast any spell on the sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were on her list of spells known. Using this ability otherwise has all of the benefits and limitations of the wishbound arcana ability. This ability replaces the bloodline bonus feat gained at 19th level.

Bushwhacker (Gunslinger)		KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]
The bushwhacker specializes in the art of the ambush. For her, gunplay works best when it comes from a concealed position and is directed against a target that falls with the very first volley and is dead before the smoke clears. A bushwhacker has the following class features.
Trembling Grit (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, at the start of each day, a bushwhacker gains grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier - 1 (minimum of 1). In addition to all the ways any gunslinger can regain grit, a bushwhacker who reduces a helpless or unaware opponent to 0 hit points or fewer also regains 1 grit point. This expands the way in which the bushwhacker gains grit points, so a bushwhacker who gains grit points in this way only gains 1 grit point for reducing a helpless or unaware opponent, not 2 grit points. This otherwise works like the gunslinger's grit ability and alters that ability.
Craven Deeds (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A bushwhacker replaces some of her deeds with the following deeds. This ability otherwise works like the gunslinger's deed ability and alters that ability.
Shifty Shot (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 3rd level, a bushwhacker with at least 1 grit point deals 1d6 points of extra damage when using her firearm to attack opponents denied their Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not). Except for the requirement that she must use a firearm and must have at least 1 grit point to use it, this deed otherwise works identically to a rogue's sneak attack class feature (including the requirement that she must be within 30 feet of her target to deal this extra damage), and stacks with the sneak shot ability (see below) and sneak attack. This deed replaces the utility shot deed.
Long Range Shifty Shot (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 7th level, a bushwhacker can double the range at which she deals extra damage from a sneak attack or shifty shot (from 30 feet to 60 feet) with a firearm by spending 1 grit point. When she spends this grit point, she must still have at least 1 grit point left to deal extra damage from shifty shot if she is using this deed. This deed replaces the targeting deed.
Sneak Shot (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, a bushwhacker deals 1d6 points of extra damage when using a firearm to attack opponents who are unable to properly defend themselves. Unlike with the shifty shot ability, she deals this extra damage regardless of whether or not she has any grit points when making the attack. Except for the requirement that she makes a firearm attack, this works identically to a rogue's sneak attack class feature. This extra damage stacks with sneak attack and the damage from shifty shot. This ability replaces the bonus feats the gunslinger gains at 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th level.

While many kobold sorcerers tout their purely draconic bloodline, over generations of eldritch training, some such spellcasters have created a bloodline that, while tinged with some draconic magic, is the embodiment of the race's virtue distilled into arcane form. Many practitioners of this bloodline go on to lead powerful kobold tribes.

Trap Rune (Sp) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, as a standard action, you can sketch a single, nearly invisible magical rune on any 5-foot-square solid surface. When you create a rune, pick one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. While the rune is active, the next creature other than you who steps on or touches the rune's area causes the rune to explode. The rune's explosion deals a number of points of energy damage equal to 1d8 + 1 per sorcerer level you possess to anything in its square. A Ref lex saving throw halves the damage (DC 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier). The rune is considered a magical trap for the purpose of perceiving it or disabling it. The DC for both Perception and Disable Device checks is the same as the Ref lex saving throw to halve the damage. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. Each rune lasts for 24 hours or until discharged.
Trap Sense (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 3rd level, you develop a sixth sense that helps you avoid traps. You gain a +2 bonus on Perception checks made to notice traps. You also gain a +1 bonus on Ref lex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 at 7th level and for every four sorcerer levels you gain thereafter (to a maximum of +5 at 19th level). This bonus stacks with that provided by a rogue's trap sense and similar abilities.

The dirty f ighter laughs at concepts like honor and fair play. He cares only for victory, no matter how he achieves it, and spends as much time mastering sneaky combat maneuvers as he does drilling with weapons or learning how to wear armor. A dirty f ighter has the following class features.
Sidestep (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 2nd level, a dirty f ighter learns how to evade his enemies when they react to his combat maneuvers. He gains a +1 dodge bonus to his AC against attacks of opportunity provoked by him while attempting a combat maneuver. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level. This ability replaces bravery.
Maneuver Training (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 5th level, a dirty fighter becomes a master of dirty tricks. He gains a +2 bonus on dirty trick combat maneuver checks (Advanced Player's Guide 320) and +2 to his CMD when he is the target of a dirty trick combat maneuver. This ability replaces weapon training 1.
Speedy Tricks (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 9th level, a dirty fighter has perfected how to quickly perform dirty tricks. He can make a dirty trick combat maneuver as an attack instead of a standard action. This ability replaces weapon training 2.
Double Tricks (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 13th level, when a dirty fighter performs a combat maneuver, he may apply two different conditions to his target instead of one. Each penalty condition requires a separate action to remove. At 17th level, he may apply three different conditions. This ability replaces weapon training 3 and 4.

Scarred Witch Doctor (Witch)		KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]
The scarred witch doctor draws power from her ability to endure pain and suffering. She mutilates her own f lesh, inf licting horrific scars, in order to attract the attention of her patron. Rather than call forth a familiar, she creates a repulsive fetish mask that she uses as a repository for her power. A scarred witch doctor has the following class features.
Constitution Dependent 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A scarred witch doctor uses Constitution instead of Intelligence when determining the highest level of spells she can cast, her spell save DCs, number of spells known at 1st level, and any effects of her hexes normally determined by her Intelligence.
Hex Scar 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Whenever a scarred witch doctor learns a hex, she must carve or brand a symbol in her f lesh to represent this hex. She can disguise these scars with mundane or magical means, but they cannot be permanently removed.
Fetish Mask (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, a scarred witch doctor forms a bond with a wooden mask. As she gains power, her connection to this mask causes it to grow ever more hideous and grotesque as it absorbs the weight of the self-induced pain that underlies her magic. Her spells derive from the insights her patron grants her while she's enduring the cuts, burns, and other sorts of mutilations she inf licts upon herself. Her fetish mask acts in all ways like a witch's familiar for the purpose of preparing and gaining spells. Rather than communing with a familiar to prepare spells each day, a scarred witch doctor hangs her mask on a wall, tree branch, or something similar and contemplates the agony it represents. When wearing her fetish mask, a scarred witch doctor gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal and Intimidate checks and gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against effects that specifically cause pain or have the pain descriptor. If the mask is destroyed, the witch doctor can create another fetish mask (which almost immediately adopts the shocking appearance of the original) for the same price and time it takes a witch to replace a dead familiar. At 5th level, the scarred witch doctor gains the ability to add magical abilities to her mask as if she had the Craft Wondrous Item feat. This ability otherwise functions like and replaces the standard witch familiar.

Base Form 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, if a shaitan binder's eidolon has the biped base form, it gains a +2 bonus to one ability score. The shaitan binder must make this choice at 1st level. If at any time the shaitan binder's eidolon has another base form, it loses this bonus until it returns to biped form. A shaitan binder's eidolon does not gain the share spells ability.
Shaitan Magic (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 4th level, a shaitan binder's eidolon gains the basic magic evolution (Ultimate Magic) as a free evolution. At 6th level, it gains the minor magic evolution (Ultimate Magic). At 8th level, it gains the major magic evolution (Ultimate Magic) as a free evolution, and adds the following to the list of available spells for that evolution: glitterdust and soften earth and stone. At 12th level, it gains the ultimate magic evolution (Ultimate Magic) as a free evolution, and adds the following to the list of available spells for that evolution: meld into stone and stone shape. Although the shaitan binder gains the standard versions of these evolutions for free, he must pay the normal cost to upgrade them to the improved versions. This ability replaces shield ally and greater shield ally.
Earth Glide (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 10th level, if a shaitan binder's eidolon has the burrow evolution, it gains the earth glide universal monster ability and can use this ability to travel at its full base speed. This ability replaces aspect.
Stone Curse (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 18th level, a shaitan binder may select stone curse as a 4-point evolution. This allows the eidolon to trap creatures in stone like the shaitan stone curse ability (Bestiary 143). The DC to resist or break free of the stone curse is 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's Hit Dice + the eidolon's Strength score. This ability replaces greater aspect.
Noble Eidolon (Sp) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 20th level, a shaitan binder's eidolon gains the ability to grant its summoner's wishes.

The wish must be spoken aloud by the shaitan binder, beginning with the words "I wish," and cannot duplicate a wish the eidolon has granted within the past 24 hours. If the eidolon uses this ability to duplicate a spell with a costly material component, the shaitan binder must provide that component. This ability replaces twin eidolon.

By following the path of the stone, students of stone give up much of monks' mobility in favor of sheer resilience. A student of stone has the following class features.
Hard as Stone (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 2nd level, whenever an opponent rolls to confirm a critical hit against a student of stone, treat the student of stone's AC as +4 higher than normal. This ability replaces evasion.

At 10th level, the student of stone adds Shaitan Style (Ultimate Combat) to his list of bonus feats, at 14th level, he adds Shaitan Skin (Ultimate Combat), and at 18th level, he adds Shaitan Earthblast (Ultimate Combat). This otherwise functions as and alters the bonus feat ability.
Bones of Stone (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 7th level, as a swift action, a student of stone can spend 1 ki point to gain DR 2/magic until the beginning of his next turn. At 10th level, he can spend 1 ki point to gain DR 2/chaotic until his next turn. At 15th level, he can spend 1 ki point to gain DR 5/chaotic until his next turn. This ability replaces high jump.

Gulch Gunner (Gunslinger)		KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]
Ratfolk warfare often occurs in cramped, claustrophobic spaces such as the ratfolk's own underground warrens and heavily trapped gulch fortresses, or the subterranean tunnels of goblins and similar foes. Since these battlegrounds often have tight corners and few areas with long lines of sight, those ratfolk who seek to master the use of firearms almost inevitably become experts in closequarters combat. These gulch gunners often specialize in proficiency with a single pistol (easily handled in tight spaces) and wander from warren to warren selling their tunnel-shooting skills to the highest bidder. A gulch gunner has the following class features.
Class Skills 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A gulch gunner adds Disable Device, Escape Artist, and Knowledge (dungeoneering) to her list of class skills and removes Knowledge (local), Ride, and Swim from her list of class skills.
Grit (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, a gulch gunner gains grit as a standard gunslinger. However, the close-combat focus of the gulch gunner results in a slightly different set of circumstances for regaining grit.
Daring Adjacent Shot 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:The first time each round the gulch gunner makes a ranged firearm attack against an adjacent foe and provokes an attack of opportunity, she regains 1 grit point. Making an adjacent firearm attack against a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gulch gunner's character level does not restore grit, nor do ranged attacks using some ability that prevents the gulch gunner from provoking an attack of opportunity. This ability replaces the ability to regain grit from a critical hit with a firearm.
Deeds 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A gulch gunner has some unique deeds, which replace some of the standard gunslinger deeds as listed in each entry. These deeds follow all the general rules and restrictions of gunslinger deeds.
Flash and Shock (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, the gulch gunner can take advantage of the f lash and sound of a firearm to throw off an attacker's aim at close range. When she makes an attack against a foe within her firearm's first range increment, she may spend 1 grit point to gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against that opponent until the beginning of her next turn. She can only perform this deed while wearing medium, light, or no armor, and while carrying no more than a light load. This deed replaces the deadeye deed.
Powder Burns (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 3rd level, the gulch gunner learns to maximize the damage dealt by a firearm at extremely close range. When the gulch gunner successfully hits an adjacent foe with a ranged firearm attack, she may spend 1 grit point to deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage from the muzzle flash of her weapon. The target must also make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the gulch gunner's level + the gulch gunner's Wisdom modifier) or catch on fire. This deed replaces the pistol whip deed.
Staggering Shot (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 15th level, when the gulch gunner hits an adjacent target with a ranged firearm attack, the target must also make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the gulch gunner's level + the gulch gunner's Wisdom modifier) or be staggered for 1d4 rounds. This deed replaces the menacing shot deed.
Belly Shot (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 9th level, a gulch gunner can press her firearm directly against a vulnerable location of an adjacent target, dealing additional damage. When the gulch gunner successfully hits an adjacent target with a ranged firearm attack, she deals +1d6 points of damage. This damage increases to +2d6 at 13th level and to +3d6 at 17th level. Creatures immune to precision damage, critical hits, or sneak attacks do not take this additional damage. This ability replaces the gun training ability gained at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

Plague Bringer (Alchemist)		KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]
The plague bringer sees disease as the ultimate weapon, and has worked tirelessly to master new diseases and disease-delivery systems. A plague bringer feels no more remorse at unleashing his armaments on his enemies than an archer does when f iring an arrow in the heat of battle. Disease is a tool, and the plague bringer is its master. A plague bringer has the following class features.
Plague Vial (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, a plague bringer can create a plague vial, an alchemically grown and concentrated disease sample. It takes 1 hour to prepare a plague vial, and once prepared, the vial remains potent until used. A plague bringer can only maintain 1 plague vial at a time-if he prepares a second vial, any existing plague vial becomes inert. A plague vial that is not in a plague bringer's possession becomes inert until a plague bringer picks it up again. It's a standard action to drink a plague vial. Upon being imbibed, the plague vial infects the plague bringer's blood, sweat, tears, and other bodily f luids for 10 minutes per class level. Any creature that harms him with melee attacks (except with reach weapons) must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the plague bringer's level + the plague bringer's Intelligence modifier) or become sickened for 1 round per plague bringer level. The plague bringer is immune to the effect of his own plague vial, but not that of another's plague vial. The effects of multiple plague vials do not stack. As a standard action, the plague bringer can infect a weapon with this sickness (typically by licking it or wiping his blood or pus on it). The disease on the weapon works like a poisoned weapon, except the source is a disease instead of a poison (so a dwarf 's resistance to poison does not apply). Anyone other than a plague bringer (including another alchemist) who drinks a plague vial must make a saving throw against the vial's DC or become nauseated for 1 hour. Unless he learns how to brew a mutagen by taking the mutagen discovery (see Ultimate Magic), he can never benefit from a mutagen and reacts to it as if he were a non-alchemist. At any particular time, a plague bringer can only be under the effect of either a plague vial or a mutagen (not both); drinking another immediately ends the effects of any ongoing plague vial or mutagen. All limitations to mutagens apply to plague vials as if they were the same substance. The infuse mutagen discovery and persistent mutagen class ability apply to plague vials. The sticky poison discovery applies to a weapon infected with a plague vial. The plague vial is a disease effect. This ability replaces mutagen.
Disease Resistance (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 2nd level, a plague bringer gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against disease. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. At 10th level, a plague bringer becomes completely immune to disease (including magical diseases). This ability replaces all increments of poison resistance and poison immunity.
Discoveries 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:The following discoveries complement the plague bringer archetype: explosive bomb, precise bombs, smoke bomb (Advanced Player's Guide); breath weapon bomb, fast bomb, nauseating bomb (Ultimate Combat); plague bomb (Ultimate Magic).

Some druids develop ties not to a particular landscape, but instead to the endless blue expanse of the skies. Such are the sky druids, who are more at home soaring through air than standing on the ground. A sky druid has the following class features.
Weapon and Armor Proficiency 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A sky druid loses medium armor proficiency.
Nature Bond (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, a sky druid who chooses an animal companion must select one with a f ly speed. If choosing a domain, the sky druid must choose from the Air, Animals, Liberation, and Weather domains, or subdomains appropriate to those domains.
Sky's Embrace (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 2nd level, a sky druid no longer takes falling damage, as though she were constantly under the effect of feather fall. Additionally, she may take ranks in the Fly skill regardless of whether she has a natural f ly speed, and may use her Fly skill in place of Acrobatics when making jump checks. This ability replaces woodland stride.
Resist Storm (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 4th level, a sky druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against spells with the air or electricity descriptors and against effects that control or modify the weather (such as sleet storm). This ability replaces resist nature's lure.
Skymaster (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 5th level, a sky druid can use the f ly spell (self only) for a number of minutes per day equal to her druid level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive. This ability replaces trackless step.
Wild Shape (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 6th level, a sky druid gains the ability to use wild shape. When a sky druid takes the form of a creature with a f ly speed, this ability functions at her class level + 1. For all other forms, her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her actual sky druid level. This ability otherwise functions as and replaces wild shape.
Soaring Form (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 9th level, a sky druid is no longer affected by altitude sickness or natural or magical wind. This ability replaces venom immunity.

Class Skills 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A wind listener adds Perception to his list of class skills.
Arcane School 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A wind listener cannot select divination or illusion as a prohibited school.
Spontaneous Divination (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, a wind listener can reshape stored spell energy into divination spells he did not prepare ahead of time. The wind listener can "lose" any prepared spell that is not a cantrip in order to cast a divination spell of the same spell level or lower. The new spell must be one the wind listener knows and is capable of casting. Spells cast with this ability increase their casting time to a full-round action (if the spell's normal casting time is longer than a full-round action, it remains unchanged). This ability replaces arcane bond.
Abjuration Sense (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 5th level, a wind listener develops a sixth sense for spotting spells designed to guard against his investigations. He gains a bonus on Perception checks equal to 1/2 his level to notice spells of the abjuration school and on Spellcraft checks to identify abjuration effects, spells, and magic items. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 5th level.
Wispy Form (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 10th level, the wind listener gains the ability to become airy and translucent as a standard action, gaining DR 10/magic and the effects of improved invisibility for a number of rounds per day equal to his level. These rounds need not be consecutive. Like the natural invisibility universal monster ability (Bestiary 2 299), this ability is not subject to invisibility purge. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 10th level.
Listening to the Wind (Sp) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 15th level, the wind listener can call upon spirits of the air to uncover lost lore about a legendary person, place, or thing. Invoking the spirits takes 10 minutes, during which time the wind listener must be free of distractions and able to concentrate. Once called, the spirits seek out information on the subject of the wind listener's inquiries. This functions as the spell legend lore (caster level equal to the wind listener's level), except that the wind listener is free to engage in other activities while spirits investigate on his behalf. The time required for the air spirits to return with this information is equal to what the casting time of the spell legend lore would have been if the wind listener had cast it. The wind listener can use this ability once per week, and only if he does not currently have air spirits searching for information. If the air spirits are currently searching for information, the wind listener can end their task early as a standard action, dismissing the magical effect and not returning any information. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 15th level.

Class Skills 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A shigenjo adds Knowledge (nature), Knowledge (religion), Knowledge (planes), and Survival to her list of class skills. These replace the additional class skills from her mystery.

These bonus spells replace the shigenjo's mystery bonus spells at these levels.
Ki Pool (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 7th level, a shigenjo gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy she can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in the shigenjo's ki pool is equal to 1/3 her oracle level + her Charisma modifier. The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the shigenjo possesses levels in another class that grants points to a ki pool, ki points gained from the shigenjo class stack with those gained from the other class to determine the total number of ki points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is permanent. The shigenjo can use ki points from this pool to power the abilities of every class she possesses that grants a ki pool. As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki pool, a shigenjo can make a ki strike as a monk whose level is equal to her oracle level - 3. As a swift action, she may spend 1 point of ki to gain one of the following benefits.
Ki Magic 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Add +1 to the DC of the next spell she casts on her turn.

Quivering Palm (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 15th level, a shigenjo may learn quivering palm as the monk ability of the same name in place of a revelation. She treats her oracle level as her monk level for this ability, and the DC is based on her Charisma bonus instead of her Wisdom bonus.
Final Revelation 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Upon reaching 20th level, you achieve true enlightenment and becomes one with the celestial spirits. You gain the ability to speak with any creature that uses a language. For a number of days equal to your Wisdom score, you can ignore the negative effects of extreme weather, starvation, thirst, and exhaustion. If you die, your powerful connection to the celestial realm allows you to be reborn 3 days later (as reincarnate). This replaces the final revelation of the shigenjo's mystery.

Swordmaster (Rogue)		KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]

Trance (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 3rd level, a swordmaster learns to focus her martial prowess using an intense meditative trance. Under the inf luence of a trance, the swordmaster can perform fantastic martial feats. Entering a trance is a fullround action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The swordmaster can maintain the trance for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Wisdom modifier. At each level beyond 3rd, she can remain in the trance for 1 additional round. She can end her trance as a free action. Following a trance, the swordmaster is fatigued for a number of rounds equal to 2 ? the number of rounds she spent in the trance. A swordmaster cannot enter a new trance while fatigued but can otherwise enter a trance multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a swordmaster falls unconscious, her trance immediately ends. At 3rd level, the swordmaster chooses one trance from the list below. She chooses another trance at 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level. She can only use one type of trance at a time.

While in this trance, a swordmaster can make an Acrobatics check opposed by an opponent's CMD. If she succeeds, she may move 5 feet as a swift action within the opponent's threatened area; this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count as a 5-foot step.
Serpent Trance (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Like the serpent, the swordmaster's quick movements allow her to catch her opponent unawares. While in this trance, a swordmaster receives a +4 bonus on Bluff checks made to feint during combat.
Tiger Trance (Ex) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.

# TIEFLING 170
Fiend Flayer (Magus)		KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]
Some tief ling magi can tap the dark energy of their fiendish blood to enhance their arcane and combat talents. By physically carving away their tainted f lesh, they can use its dark energies to enhance their powers, call forth weapons from thin air, and bypass enemies' strongest defenses. A fiend f layer has the following class features.
Infernal Mortification (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, a fiend f layer can sacrifice some of his own infernal blood to add to his arcane pool. Sacrificing blood in this way is a standard action. For every 2 points of Constitution damage the fiend f layer takes in this way, his arcane pool increases by 1 point. Any arcane pool points gained in this way and not spent disappear the next time the magus prepares his spells. Unlike normal ability score damage, this damage cannot be healed by way of lesser restoration. Only time can heal the Constitution damage taken by way of infernal mortification. This ability cannot be used if the fiend f layer's Constitution damage is equal to or greater than 1/2 his Constitution score.
Magus Arcana 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A fiend f layer gains access to the following magus arcana. He cannot select any arcana more than once.
Fiendblade (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:As a swift action, as long as the fiend f layer used infernal mortification that day to increase his arcane pool, he can conjure forth a weapon using this arcana. Doing so costs 2 points from his arcane pool. The weapon can take the form of any single one-handed melee weapon the fiend f layer is proficient with. This weapon starts as a weapon with a +1 enhancement bonus, but for every four levels beyond 3rd the fiend f layer possesses, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +5 at 19th level. This summoned weapon lasts for 1 minute. At 5th level, these bonuses can be used to add any of the following weapon properties to the fiendblade: anarchic, axiomatic, dancing, f laming, burst, frost, icy burst, keen, shock, shocking burst, speed, or unholy. These bonuses and properties are decided when the arcane pool points are spent and cannot be changed until the next time the fiend f layer uses this arcana. Another creature cannot wield the fiendblade; if it leaves the hand of the fiend f layer, it dissipates in a wisp of red smoke that smells of burning blood. A fiend f layer can only have one fiendblade in existence at a time. If he uses this ability again, the first fiendblade disappears.
Bypassing Strike (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:The fiend f layer can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to allow one melee or spellstrike attack he makes before the end of his turn to ignore an evil outsider target's damage reduction.

Fiendish Vessel (Cleric)		KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]
Many clerics pray to or make evil bargains with fiendish powers, devoting body and soul to the insane plans and wicked aims of their despicable patrons. But these mortal clerics are often just shallow beings searching for quick power or the caress of true and final oblivion-few truly grasp the full scope of the entities they worship. Fiendish vessels, through their fiendish heritage, share an innate connection with their patron, and that connection grants them understanding and power. A fiendish vessel has the following class features.
Alignment 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:Unlike normal clerics, a fiendish vessel's alignment must match her patron's.
Domains 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A fiendish vessel must select the Daemon, Demon, or Devil subdomain (Advanced Player's Guide 88- 90) as one of her domain choices, based on the fiendish patron she chooses to serve.
Channel Evil (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, a f iendish vessel, rather than channeling positive or negative energy, instead channels the pure evil power of her f iendish patron. This ability is similar to channeling negative energy, but instead of healing undead and dealing damage to living creatures, this blast of evil energy automatically heals evil creatures and debilitates good creatures within its burst. Channeling this evil causes a burst that affects all creatures in a 30-foot radius centered on the fiendish vessel. In the case of evil creatures, the amount of damage healed is equal to 1d4 points of damage and increases by 1d4 at every two levels beyond 1st (to a maximum of 10d4 at 19th level). Good creatures in the burst receive a Will saving throw to negate this damage. Good creatures that fail their saving throws are sickened for 1d4 rounds. Good creatures with a number of Hit Dice less than or equal to the fiendish vessel's class level - 5 that fail their saving throws are nauseated for 1 round and then sickened for 1d4 rounds instead. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the fiendish vessel's level + the fiendish vessel's Charisma bonus. Neutral creatures are unaffected by this burst of evil energy. A fiendish vessel may channel this energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. Doing so is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A fiendish vessel can choose whether or not to include herself in this effect. A fiendish vessel must present her unholy symbol or use her familiar as the divine focus for this ability. For the purposes of feats that affect channel energy, this ability counts as channeling negative energy. If the feat changes the way the fiendish vessel channels or deals damage with her channeling, use the amount of damage this ability heals evil creatures to determine the damage-dealing potential of the affected ability. For instance, if a 5th-level f iendish vessel takes the Channel Smite feat, her channeling deals an additional 3d4 points of damage to living creatures on a successful hit (though they may save to negate the damage). This ability replaces channel energy.

#171

Fiendish Familiar 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 3rd level, a f iendish vessel's patron rewards her with a fiendish servant. The f iendish vessel gains an imp, quasit, or cacodaemon familiar based on the patron she worships. If she worships Asmodeus or an archdevil, she gets an imp; if she worships a demon lord, she gets a quasit; and if she worships one of the Four Horsemen, she gains a cacodaemon. This ability is identical to the wizard's arcane bond with a familiar and the Improved Familiar feat, using the f iendish vessel's character level in place of the wizard level. This tiny fiend acts like a perverse, manifest moral compass. Furthermore, this familiar can act as a living divine focus and unholy symbol for her spellcasting if the fiendish vessel so desires, which means that when she uses her channel evil ability, its burst can be centered on the familiar instead, as long as that familiar is within 30 feet and line of sight. A fiendish vessel's familiar tends to be fawning and subservient to the fiendish vessel. Should her familiar die, the fiendish vessel's patron replaces the familiar with an identical one within 1 week, without the need for a special ritual. Furthermore, the fiendish familiar gains the following special abilities beyond the standard familiar special abilities.

#172

Fiendish Augury (Sp) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 3rd level, the fiendish vessel can ask the familiar whether a particular course of action will bring good or bad results for her in the immediate future. This ability acts like the augury spell, with a caster level equal to the fiendish vessel's level, with the familiar acting as the mouthpiece for the spell. This ability can be used once per day.
Fiendish Divination (Sp) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 9th level, the fiendish vessel can use a more powerful form of divination to gain intelligence from her patron through her fiendish familiar. This ability acts like the divination spell, with a caster level equal to the fiendish vessel's level; the familiar acts as the mouthpiece for the spell. This ability can be used once per day.
Extra Divination (Sp) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 13th level, the fiendish vessel can gain intelligence from her patron more often each day. She can use fiendish divination up to 3 times per day.
Fiendish Summoning 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:When casting summon monster spells, a f iendish vessel is limited to summoning f iendish creatures and evil outsiders of the same alignment as her patron.

An undine adept dedicates herself to preserving the knowledge of the first undines and ensuring her people's ancient connections to the natural world remain undisturbed.

Augment Summoning (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 3rd level, any creature with the water subtype the undine adept summons with either summon monster or summon nature's ally gains the benefits of the Augment Summoning feat. This replaces trackless step.
Resist Water's Call (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 4th level, an undine adept gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of outsiders with the aquatic or water subtype, fey with the aquatic or water subtype, and spells and effects with the water descriptor. This ability replaces resist nature's lure.
Wild Shape (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 6th level, an undine adept gains the ability to use wild shape. When an undine takes the form of a creature with the aquatic or water subtype, this ability functions at her class level + 1. For all other forms, her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her actual undine adept level. This ability otherwise functions as and replaces wild shape.
Commune with Water Spirits 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 9th level, an undine adept adds commune to her druid spell list. She may use this spell whether she worships a deity or elemental forces. This ability replaces venom immunity.

Watersinger (Bard)		KEY:xxx Archetype	CATEGORY:Archetype		TYPE:Archetype.xxxArchetype		PRECLASS:1,xxx=1	PRERACE:1,x	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,xxx Archetype ~ x],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.x]
The watersinger's song reaches from the depths of his soul into the elemental waters from which life first sprang. His voice commands water, bending and shaping it to his desire.
Bardic Performance 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A watersinger has some unique bardic performances, which replace some of the standard bardic performances as listed in each entry. These bardic performances follow all the general rules and restrictions of a bard's bardic performances.
Watersong (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 1st level, a watersinger can use bardic performance to manipulate and control the shape of water within 30 feet. A successful Perform check allows the bard to animate and control a 5-foot-cube of water. The watersinger can command the water to take various forms, bend, rise, fall, or sustain a shape, and can make it support weight as if it were solid ice. For example, the watersinger could create a pillar of water (to provide cover), ladder, channel, bridge, stairs, slide, and so on. The manipulated water is as slippery as normal ice. This ability cannot create forms more fragile or complex than what could be carved in normal ice. While under the bard's control, the water has hardness 0 and 3 hit points per inch of thickness. At level 3, the manipulated water gains hardness 1, and this increases by +1 for every 3 bard levels beyond that. At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, the volume affected increases by an additional 5-foot cube (these cubes must be adjacent to each other). The manipulated water retains its shape for 1 round after the bard stops spending bardic performance rounds to maintain it. This ability replaces fascinate, suggestion, and mass suggestion.

#177
Waterstrike (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 3rd level, the watersinger can spend 1 round of bardic performance to command any water he is currently manipulating with his watersong performance to lash out and strike an opponent with a slam attack. The watersinger uses his base attack bonus and Charisma bonus to make this attack, and deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage plus his Charisma bonus. The attack can originate from any square of water the bard is manipulating, and the water can get a f lanking bonus or help a combatant get one, but cannot make attacks of opportunity. The water can make multiple attacks per round if your base attack bonus allows you to do so. At 10th level, the water's slam damage increases to 1d8 points and the water gains a reach of 10 feet. At 15th level, the water's slam damage increases to 2d6 points. At 20th level, the water's slam damage increases to 2d8 points. This performance replaces inspire competence.
Lifewater (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 5th level, the watersinger can spend 1 round of bardic performance as a standard action to manipulate the water, blood, and other f luids within a creature's body, causing the target to become sickened for 1d4 rounds. Alternatively, he may use this ability to attempt a reposition combat maneuver (Advanced Player's Guide), using his base attack bonus and his Charisma modifier as his CMB. This ability has a range of 30 feet, only works on creatures whose bodies contain f luid, and does not affect creatures that are immune to critical hits. This performance replaces the use of lore master gained at 5th level (though a watersinger still gains the use of lore master once per day at 11th level and twice per day at 17th).
Watersinger Spells 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A watersinger adds certain waterthemed spells to his spell list.

TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:A dreamweaver replaces some of her patron's spells with the following: 2nd-sow thoughts (see below), 4th-dust of twilight (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide), 6th-deep slumber, 8th-modify memory, 10th-dream, 12th- cloak of dreams (Advanced Player's Guide), 14th-ethereal jaunt, 16th-moment of prescience, 18th-astral projection.
Dream Spinner (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 2nd level, when a dreamweaver casts a mind-affecting spell on a target that is sleeping because of her slumber hex or a spell she cast, she adds +1 to the mind-affecting spell's DC. If the target succeeds at the saving throw against the spell, it does not wake up, nor does it have any recollection of having resisted a spell. If appropriate, the dreamweaver may incorporate elements of a mind-affecting spell (i.e., sow thought, suggestion, and so on) into the target's subconscious so it believes the spell's effects originated in its dreams (the details of how these elements fit into the dream is up to the GM). This ability replaces the witch's hex gained at 2nd level.
Dream Thief (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 6th level, a dreamweaver can alter the sleeping mind of any creature that is sleeping because of her slumber hex or a spell she cast. She can reshape one of the target's memories as if using modify memory. Alternatively, she may insert herself into the dreaming memories of the target, prompting the target's mind to show her some specific information; the dreamer's subconscious may resist, or try to deceive her with out-ofcontext memories, similar to the way a corpse can resist when questioned with speak with dead. A Will save negates either effect (DC equal to that of the witch's hex). Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day. This ability replaces the witch's hex gained at 6th level.
Dream Possession (Su) 	KEY: ~ yyy		SOURCEPAGE:p.	TYPE:ArchetypeAbility.SpecialQuality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	DESC:At 10th level, a dreamweaver can take control of any creature that is sleeping because of her slumber hex or a spell she cast. This effect functions as magic jar, using the witch's familiar acting as the soul receptacle. A Will save negates either effect (DC equal to that of the witch's hex). Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day. This ability replaces the witch's hex gained at 10th level.

###Block: Dwarven Weapons
# Light
Helmet (Dwarven Boulder)	WIELD:Light	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Helmet (Dwarven Boulder)	OUTPUTNAME:Helmet, Dwarven Boulder	COST:20	DAMAGE:1d4	CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	WT:10	TYPE:Headgear.Weapon.Melee.Dwarven.Bludgeoning.Exotic	SPROP:This heavy, reinforced helmet can be used to make melee attacks. The wearer may also use the helmet when attempting bull rush maneuvers, granting a +2 circumstance bonus on the check, but after completing the maneuver (whether successful or not), the wearer is staggered until the end of his next turn. In addition, the helmet grants a +2 circumstance bonus to the wearer's AC against critical hit confirmation rolls. A dwarven boulder helmet adds 20%% to the wearer's arcane spell failure chance. It occupies the head slot and is made of metal, not stone, meaning that it can be crafted from unusual materials as a metal weapon. A dwarven boulder helmet can be enchanted as a weapon (not as armor, despite providing some protection).|PRERULE:1,DisplayWeaponDetails	SPELLFAILURE:20

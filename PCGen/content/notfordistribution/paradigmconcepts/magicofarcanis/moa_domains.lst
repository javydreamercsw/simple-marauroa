#Holy	BENEFIT:Choose a component of your alignment (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law). Your chosen component is used to determine the components of all the alignment-based domain spells listed below. Your domain spells affect the alignment that is the polar opposite of your chosen component. (For example, if you choose Good, then your first-level domain spell is protection from evil.) You cast all Holy domain spells at +1 caster level.

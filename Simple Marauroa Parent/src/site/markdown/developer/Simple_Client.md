title: Simple Client
---
This client is just, simple.

It has just 3 files:

* **log4j.properties**: handles the log messages
* **TextClient**: A modified version of the file within Stendhal that basically is able to connect to the simple-server, create an account if needed and display the received perceptions.
* **Client**: It's just an abstraction of the one implemented in TextClient. Meant to be the building block for other clients.
